Hello! 

My name is Maria Duhamel, and I’m a computer science student with a strong interest in human-centered AI, embedded systems, and generative technologies. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve developed a diverse set of technical and analytical skills that span software engineering, hardware integration, data management, and real-time systems. This ePortfolio showcases my growth, achievements, and readiness to contribute meaningfully to the field of computer science.

Over the course of the program, I’ve gained hands-on experience in:

•	Embedded system design and hardware-software integration
•	Algorithm development and data structure optimization
•	Database design and implementation in resource-constrained environments
•	Cloud communication simulation and real-time data handling
•	Software engineering principles, including modular design and maintainability

These skills have been cultivated through challenging coursework, collaborative projects, and personal exploration. I’ve learned to approach problems methodically, iterate solutions, and reflect critically on my work.
One of the most impactful projects I completed was the “Wiring an LED Display” system, developed during CS 350: Emerging Systems Architectures and Technologies. This thermostat system integrates sensors, LEDs, an LCD, and UART communication to simulate cloud data transmission. I evaluated multiple hardware platforms, Raspberry Pi, Microchip, and Freescale, to determine the most suitable option for real-world deployment.
This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a complex embedded system, showcasing skills in system analysis, peripheral integration, and hardware selection. It was both technically challenging and personally rewarding, and I chose it for my capstone because it reflects my passion for building responsive, real-world systems.

For the capstone, I enhanced the project by:

•	Implementing a moving average algorithm using collections.deque to smooth temperature readings and reduce sensor noise.
•	Replacing original temperature functions with a new get_smoothed_fahrenheit() function and updating control logic accordingly.
•	Integrating an SQLite database to log temperature readings, system states, and set points, with schema constraints and performance-optimized indexes.
•	Creating a SQL view to summarize average temperatures by system state for quick analysis.

These enhancements demonstrate my ability to apply efficient data structures, real-time algorithms, and persistent data storage solutions in embedded environments. They align with real-world practices in IoT and edge computing, and directly support the following program outcomes:

1.	Software Design and Development
2.	Systems and Architecture
3.	Data and Information Management
4.	Algorithms and Theory
5.	Professional and Ethical Responsibilities

This capstone experience has been a culmination of everything I’ve learned in the CS program. It challenged me to refine my technical skills, think critically about system design, and communicate with my work effectively. I’m proud of the progress I’ve made and excited to apply these skills in future roles that blend innovation, engineering, and human-centered design.
